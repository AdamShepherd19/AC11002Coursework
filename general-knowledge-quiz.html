        <p>This is the project that I developed over the course of 4 months for my Advanced Higher Computing coursework. It is written in Python and consists of ten multiple choice questions. The user is prompted for a username then completes the quiz. Their score is recorded and if they would like to, is is stored in a leaderboard along with their username. The leaderboard uses an array of records to store the data and is sorted in descending order of score using a bubble sort. <br><br>
        A lot of planning and initial research went into this project to ensure it was being created for the correct audience. I carried out user surveys and questionnaires to narrow down the requirements. I created use case scenarios and user personas to identify the audience. I used a Gantt chart to keep track of my progress and as a record of what i have completed.</p>
